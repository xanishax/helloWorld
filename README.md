To install a GitHub Pakage in R you may need *devtools*. If so, please run the following code: 
```R 
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")
```

You can install an R package that is publicly available in GitHub by using the following code (replacing **GitHubName/repo** with the correct information): 

```R 
devtools::install_github('GitHubName/repo')
```

You can also create links to files in your repository, for example the script ["hello.R"](R/hello.R) in the R folder
